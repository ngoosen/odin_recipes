<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A delicious apple crumb cake. Finally, after all these years, I've come up with a solution for people who can't decide whether to make an apple crumble or a coffee cake. This features the best things about both of those recipes. It's like baking a crumb-topped coffee cake on top of another coffee cake!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dry Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
  <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Crumble Mixture:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 ½ cups finely chopped toasted walnuts</li>
  <li>⅓ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
  <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wet Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
  <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
  <li>2 large eggs</li>
  <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
  <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
  <li>2 Honeycrisp apples</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Gather your ingredients.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x12-inch baking dish generously.</li>
  <li>Mix dry ingredients: Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Make the crumble: Combine walnuts, brown sugar, white sugar, melted butter, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mix until walnuts and sugar are thoroughly coated with butter.</li>
  <li>Mix the wet ingredients: Cream sugar and butter together in another bowl with a spatula until well blended.</li>
  <li>Add 1 egg and whisk until mixture is smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Whisk in second egg until thoroughly incorporated. Add yogurt and vanilla; whisk together.</li>
  <li>Add dry flour mixture to wet ingredients; whisk just until flour disappears. Do not overmix.</li>
  <li>Remove cores from apples. Cut across into 1/8- to 1/4-inch slices. Stack up a few slices, make a cut down the center, and dice across into cubes.</li>
  <li>Add to cake batter, folding in with a spatula until just combined.</li>
  <li>Spread 1/2 of the batter evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Scatter 1/2 of the crumble mixture evenly over the top.</li>
  <li>Top with the rest of the batter in dollops. Spread carefully to evenly distribute, trying not to disturb the crumbs.</li>
  <li>Top with the rest of the crumb mixture. Press crumbs into the batter very gently.</li>
  <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until a toothpick or bamboo skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.</li>
  <li>Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes, before slicing and serving.</li>
</ol>
